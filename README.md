# Tenzies

Tenzies is another toy project I built to help me learn the concepts of React. The rules of Tenzies are simple; roll the dice until all are the same. Play the game yourself [here](https://kate2797.github.io/tenzies-react/) âœ¨.

## Features
* Roll dice
* Freeze a die
* Tracking current score
* Tracking all time best score (using localStorage)
* Star over
